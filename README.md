# Docker Image Recipes for the AstroContainers Project

This repository contains recipes for building Docker images for the
AstroContainers project.
Each subdirecotry (except `bin/`) contains the Dockerfile and
necessary files to build a Docker image.
They are in general set up for auto-build on Docker Hub.
For more simple images that does not require specific Dockerfile, they
are listed in `*-images.md` and designed for auto-build on GitHub.
